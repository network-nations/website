      - "NEITHER"
      - "LOCAL"
      - "NOR"
      - "GLOBAL"
      - "BUT"
      - "TRANSLOCAL"
    text: "A network of geographically unbound but interconnected local units. This structure allows for communities that are both locally rooted and globally connected, enabling them to act collectively as a larger, interwoven whole without being confined to a single territory."

  - title:
      - "NEITHER"
      - "CENTRALIZED"
      - "NOR"
      - "DECENTRALISED"
      - "BUT"
      - "POLYCENTRIC"
    text: "A system with multiple centers of decision-making that have mutual influence over one another. Unlike a top-down centralized model or a fully flat decentralized one, polycentricity allows for nested, overlapping, and autonomous governance bodies to coexist and coordinate."

  - title:
      - "NEITHER"
      - "SUPREMACY"
      - "NOR"
      - "SUBORDINATION"
      - "BUT"
      - "FUNCTIONAL SOVEREIGNTY"
    text: "The capacity for a community to self-organise and govern its own affairs independent of external interference. This form of sovereignty is not based on territorial control, but on the functional ability to manage its own systems and resources, empowering civil society."

  - title:
      - "NEITHER"
      - "STATE"
      - "NOR"
      - "MARKET"
      - "BUT"
      - "COMMONS"
    text: "An economic and governance model based on the mutualisation of resources. Instead of resources being controlled exclusively by the public sector (State) or private sector (Market), they are collectively owned and managed by a community, including the governance infrastructure itself."

  - title:
      - "NEITHER"
      - "DEPENDENT"
      - "NOR"
      - "INDEPENDENT"
      - "BUT"
      - "INTERDEPENDENT"
    text: "A state of 'entanglement' that creates a shared future through incentive alignment. By creating high exit costs and shared stakes, this model fosters deep collaboration over pure independence, which helps mitigate free-riding and the tragedy of the commons."

  - title:
      - "NEITHER"
      - "EXIT-BASED"
      - "NOR"
      - "VOICE-BASED"
      - "BUT"
      - "STAKE-BASED"
    text: "A governance model where influence is tied to one's stake in the community. This moves beyond the traditional dichotomy of 'exit' (leaving) or 'voice' (protesting). Having a tangible stake—economic, social, or reputational—incentivizes constructive participation."

  - title:
      - "NEITHER"
      - "POLITICAL"
      - "NOR"
      - "APOLITICAL"
      - "BUT"
      - "METAPOLITICAL"
    text: "Operating on a level that shapes the conditions for future politics. The agenda is to empower civil society with more agency for self-governance while acknowledging planetary interdependencies, creating new (geo)political actors through commons-based stewardship."

  - title:
      - "NEITHER"
      - "INSIDERS"
      - "NOR"
      - "OUTSIDERS"
      - "BUT"
      - "BEYONDERS"
    text: "Transcending the dichotomy of working within the system or fighting it from the outside. Inspired by Buckminster Fuller, Beyonders focus on building new models that make the existing reality obsolete, creating alternative systems that operate on different principles."

  - title:
      - "NEITHER"
      - "TECHNO-UTOPIAN"
      - "NOR"
      - "TECHNO-DYSTOPIAN"
      - "BUT"
      - "TECHNO-REALISTS"
    text: "Adopting a pragmatic and balanced view of technology. This approach avoids both blind optimism and paralyzing fear, focusing instead on thoughtfully designing and deploying tools to serve community values, acknowledging both their potential and their limitations."

  - title:
      - "NEITHER"
      - "DESCRIPTIVE"
      - "NOR"
      - "PRESCRIPTIVE"
      - "BUT"
      - "EMERGENT"
    text: "A process-based approach to solving complex problems like the 'polycrisis.' Rather than prescribing a rigid solution, this focuses on creating an interconnected, adaptive system from which novel solutions can emerge through the interactions of its empowered members."
