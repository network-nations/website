These guiding principles provide a compass, but a compass is only useful with a crew to navigate.

We operate on a light-touch "social contract," focused on stewarding our shared story and creating a welcoming space for exploration.

Our role is to nurture the ecosystem by:

- Refining the ideas through collaborative writing and research.
- Weaving the movement by connecting diverse experiments and people.
- Building bridges with like-minded groups and frameworks.
- Sharing the vision through conversations, podcasts, and public forums.
