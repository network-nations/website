These guiding principles provide a compass, but a compass is only useful with a crew to navigate.

We operate on a light-touch "social contract," focused on stewarding our shared story and creating a welcoming space for exploration.

Our role is to nurture the ecosystem by:

<ul style="padding-left: 18px; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 0; font-size: 15px;">
<li>Refining the ideas through collaborative writing and research.</li>
<li>Weaving the movement by connecting diverse experiments and people.</li>
<li>Building bridges with like-minded groups and frameworks.</li>
<li>Sharing the vision through conversations, podcasts, and public forums.</li>
</ul>
