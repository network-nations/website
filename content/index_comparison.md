title: "Contrasting Network States vs. Network Nations"
---

## Network States

A network state is a coordinated online community that seeks territorial control and formal sovereignty through a start-up logic: raise capital, acquire land, and negotiate recognition from existing nation-states. It grows like a company and aims to exit the current system.

- Territorial sovereignty
- Top-down, investor-driven (start-up society)
- Exit-based (buy land, secede)
- Market logic (CEO as leader)
- Competition, extraction
- Corporate machine

## Network Nations

A network nation is a community-rooted, commons-driven civic fabric that builds functional sovereignty through culture, cooperation, and shared stewardship. It doesn't secede — it grows legitimacy through practice, belonging, and the capacity to care for people and place.

- Functional sovereignty
- Bottom-up, community-driven
- Stake-based (members as co-creators)
- Commons logic (collective stewardship)
- Cooperation, mutual care
- Civic imagination
